# Spring Boot based Java web application
 
This is a simple Sprint Boot based Java application that can be built using Maven. Sprint Boot dependencies are handled using the pom.xml 
at the root directory of the repository.

This is a MVC architecture based application where controller returns a page with title and message attributes to the view.

## Execute the application locally and access it using your browser

Checkout the repo and move to the directory

```
git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero/java-maven-sonar-argocd-helm-k8s/sprint-boot-app
cd java-maven-sonar-argocd-helm-k8s/sprint-boot-app
```

Execute the Maven targets to generate the artifacts

```
mvn clean package
```

The above maven target stroes the artifacts to the `target` directory. You can either execute the artifact on your local machine
(or) run it as a Docker container.

** Note: To avoid issues with local setup, Java versions and other dependencies, I would recommend the docker way. **


### Execute locally (Java 11 needed) and access the application on http://localhost:8080

```
java -jar target/spring-boot-web.jar
```

### The Docker way

Build the Docker Image

```
docker build -t ultimate-cicd-pipeline:v1 .
```

```
docker run -d -p 8010:8080 -t ultimate-cicd-pipeline:v1
```

Hurray !! Access the application on `http://localhost:8010`
